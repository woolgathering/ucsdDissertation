\chapter{Decomposing and Resynthesizing Audio}
An elementary use of the PT in audio is for the decomposition and resynthesis of audio signals.

In contrast to other literature where it is sufficient to detect the presence of periodicities in a signal, the manipulation of audio requires one to retrieve the periodic waveforms themselves.

A requirement of a PT on audio data is its ability to handle non-integer periods, in contrast to something like DNA sequencing where periods are guarenteed to be integers.

\subsection{Mixed Waves}
An interesting phenomenon that is not necessarily unexpected is ``waveform interference'' whereby discovered waveforms bear features of other waveforms in the signal. Below is a signal comprised of a sine ($p = 100$), a square ($p = 171$), and a sawtooth ($p = 203$) which was analyzed using the QO method:

Figure XXX shows the orignal periods compared against the periodic components derived from the QO. Note that despite their mututal prime-ness, the waveforms ``interfere'' with one another with regard to their shapes.
